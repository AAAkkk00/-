It is predicted that if the week-by-week change recorded this time continues on its present course, there will be more than double the current number of new positive cases two weeks from now. As such, there are concerns about a resurgence in cases."

There is the need to build up systems so that patients that require hospitalization, such as those with severe symptoms and those with moderate symptoms who are at especially high risk of developing severe symptoms, can be hospitalized."
